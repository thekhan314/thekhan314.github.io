As I worked through the Module 1 lessons and Module 1 project, something struck me as interesting: the recommended technique for transforming features to make them more normally distributed. The lessons say to apply a logarithm function and show us how to do so. Since it's been a while since I had been exposed to the math, I thought I'd take a deeper dive and see how log normalization works behind the scene. 

So here is a refresher. When we raise a number to an exponent, we multiply it by itself that many times. So 10 raised to the power 2 is 10 x 10 = 100.
